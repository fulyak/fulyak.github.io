## About

Hello there! Welcome to my personal website.

I am currently a PhD student at Northwestern/[CIERA](https://ciera.northwestern.edu) as a Fulbright and CIERA BoV Fellow. My research interests include the dynamical evolution of dense star clusters and astrophysical applications of gravitational microlensing. I am also interested in computational aspects of my field, particularly N-body simulations and parallel algorithms. I perform N- body simulations of realistic star clusters using our recently publicized Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) code, which has been continuously developed since the early 2000s. Check out our Monte-Carlo code (CMC) for simulations of dense star clusters [here](https://clustermontecarlo.github.io).

Outside my academic life as a researcher, I am passionate about teaching and getting engaged in outreach activities. I am a part of the STEM outreach and engagement by contributing to IDEASpy/[REACHpy](https://sites.northwestern.edu/cierahs/).
